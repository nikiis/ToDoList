# TODO List 

Yes, it is yet another TODO List, but this time it actually **saves** your todo items. This TODO list application was implemented using node.js and mongoDB to ensure you never forget your TODO items :) 

You can view the deployed web app here: https://radiant-mountain-67773.herokuapp.com/

You can also create a custom list by simply adding the name of your new todo list at the end of the URL. 
For example: https://radiant-mountain-67773.herokuapp.com/\<custom name\> 

To set this up locally, simply:
- Clone/download this repo
- On terminal, write: `npm i` to install dependencies
- On terminal, write: `node app.js` and then on your browser, go to: "localhost:3000"
